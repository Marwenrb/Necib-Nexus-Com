EMERGENCY FIX FOR ONE.COM HOSTING
==============================

This is a temporary emergency solution to get a basic site up and running on one.com while you work on a permanent solution for your Next.js site.

INSTRUCTIONS:
------------

1. Upload all files from this 'fix-site' folder to the root of your one.com hosting.

2. Make sure the .htaccess file is uploaded correctly (it's a hidden file).

3. Important: Copy all your favicon files, images, and other static assets to the root folder.

WHAT THIS DOES:
--------------

This is a greatly simplified version of your site that:
- Doesn't rely on the complex _next directory structure
- Doesn't use any external JavaScript dependencies
- Uses inline CSS instead of external files
- Has a simple loader that transitions to basic content

WHY THIS WORKS:
--------------

One.com seems to be having issues with:
1. Serving JavaScript files with correct MIME types
2. Handling the complex routing of Next.js
3. Processing the nested directory structure of the _next folder

PERMANENT SOLUTIONS:
------------------

1. Use a hosting provider better suited for Next.js:
   - Vercel (works perfectly with Next.js)
   - Netlify
   - Cloudflare Pages

2. Work with one.com support to resolve the specific issues

3. Convert your site to a simpler static site without the complexity of Next.js
